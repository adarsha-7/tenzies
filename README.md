# Tenzies
### A simple dice game where players roll ten dice and aim to get all of them to show the same number by freezing matches and re-rolling the rest. The player with the fewest rolls wins.

## Tech Stack
#### - HTML + Tailwind CSS + React

## Additional info
#### - This is my first frontend project using React, where I applied the basics of components, props, state, side effects, conditional rendering, event handling, etc. while building a fully functional and interactive game.
